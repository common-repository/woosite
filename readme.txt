== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to install the WooSite plugin =

The **WooSite** plugin is currently only needed if you wish to add tracking information to customer emails and to the customer account section, it is also used to update the shipping or billing address of a customer (sometimes they make a mistake or ask to change address).

Basically if you only want to view and update the status of orders then you do not need the **WooSite** plugin.
